\section{Work Completed}
\subsection*{Using the Tools}
Before starting this project, I had no experience using OCaml, Irmin\footnote{Irmin is a library which uses a Git backend to provide a immutable block store} or Lwt\footnote{Lwt is a library used to handle threading in OCaml}.
I spent some time learning OCaml as a language and how to write idiomatic, thread-safe code. 
I have also now become very familiar with Ezirmin which provides a simplified API to Irmin. \\
This work was completed in the first half of Michaelmas, in accordance with my initial work schedule.
\subsection*{Building a Distributed Ledger}
My proposal suggested that I would have built the functionality for adding data to the blockchain by the end of Michaelmas. 
Whilst I was one to two weeks behind with this work, it has now been built and is functioning.
\subsection*{Consensus Protocol}
In my project proposal, I declared that I would need to do some research on which consensus algorithm would be the most suitable for using in my project. 
I suggested options including Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Paxos and Raft.\\
I have completed extensive research on these protocols and decided that I would like to combine the Proof of Work algorithm with a leader based approach such as the one employed by Raft. This will be done by using Proof of Work to periodically reallocate a leader in a group of nodes.\\
There have been a few difficulties faced with using Ezirmin which have delayed progress on building consensus into the project. 
I have also come to realise that this is by far the most substantial piece of work required for this project - more so than suggested in my proposal.\\
I therefore running roughly 2-3 weeks behind with this work.
\subsection*{Dissertation}
Work on the written dissertation has been going well. 
I have completed a first draft of an Introduction and Preparation section and am running roughly 2 weeks ahead of schedule with this.
This should go some way to making up for the delay in building the consensus module.
\section{Changes to the Original Proposal}
There is still work to be done, as outlined in my original project proposal, however there are a couple of things which have changed slightly.\\
In working with Ezirmin, I have discovered a bug that has set me back slightly. I am working with KC - my supervisor and the library's author - in order to work around this.\\
I now believe that building of my evaluation program will not take as long as suggested in my propoasl (the first 6 weeks of lent).
Whilst, I will be starting work on this after I suggested in my proposal, I believe that due to my greater proficiency with OCaml and scripting languages, it should only take around 3 weeks to complete.
